# Open API Spec

Assuming you have a working NodeJS and Python environment set up:

```shell
# Serve the site(s) using Docker
make serve
# Linting check:
make lint
# Formatting in accordance with linting check:
make format
# Mock the API:
make mock
```

You can now see the newly designed spec at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and the generated spec at [localhost:8080/generated](http://localhost:8080/generated).
